# WeatherApp
Weather app as my final project of arbisoft IOS development fellowship.

This app uses weatherbit current API for current weather and their seven day forcast API for the forecast.

To use this app please first update the API key in **HomepageInteractor.swift**.
Also make sure that you have both **lottie-ios** and **ViewAnimator** packages installed.
